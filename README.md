VERSION 3.3 RELEASED

A Quarto extension for adding a custom title page or book cover to your PDF output using the information in the YAML in your Quarto doc, i.e. from the `xyz.qmd` for an single doc and from `index.qmd` for a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) book.

## Install the extension

```bash
quarto use template nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages
```

This will install the extension plus all the demo files. Essentially, you will be cloning the repo into a new folder and you will be asked at installation for the name of the (empty) folder/directory that you want to install into.

## Install for an existing document

You may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document. This will install only the files in the `_extension` folder and will not install the files above that (the demo files).

From the quarto project or document directory, run the following command:

```bash
quarto install extension nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages
```

## Usage

In your document yaml add the format and a titlepage theme.

```yaml
format: 
  titlepage-pdf:
    coverpage: great-wave
    titlepage: bg-image
```

Then render the document. See the documentation for the possible themes.

## Customizing

All aspects of the title and cover pages can be customized and static pages (e.g. copyright) can be added after the title page. [Read the documentation](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/quarto_titlepages/). tldr; In your yaml, you pass in `titlepage-theme:` or `coverpage-theme:` with variables for things like font, fontstyle, position of elements, colors, background images, etc.

## LaTeX users

If you have a title page and/or cover page, that you want to use directly. You might want to look at [quarto_titlepages_v1](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages). This shows you how to create your own Pandoc templates so you can get control of the title page in your tex files. Alternatively, if you have a static title or cover page, see the documentation chapter on using static tex files in your frontmatter.
